Takes language with encoded data:
  - The cartesian coordinates
  - The direction with respect to the rest of the path
Massive Advantage:
  - Unified simple interface for coding maze alghorithms (i.e. regardless of
    implmentation [data structures, logic, ***encoded data***])
  - Compiler runs in O(n)
